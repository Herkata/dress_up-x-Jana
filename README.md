# ✨ TikTok Filter

🎥 Created with **Effect House** — combining real-time interactivity with custom visuals

## 💡 About the Project

This TikTok effect was built as a **creative collaboration** between two best friends:
- 🎨 **Graphics** by my high school best friend, designed to be playful and vibrant [@jana_papp on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jana_papp/)
- 🧠 **Interactivity** by me, using scripting and backend logic to make the experience dynamic

We set out to create an effect that feels both **visually unique** and **interactive**, using TikTok’s **Effect House** platform.

## 🛠️ What It Does

- 🌀 Real-time reactive effects (e.g., based on user expression or taps)
- 🔄 Dynamic visual transitions based on user movement or input

## ⚙️ Tech Behind It

- **Effect House** scripting (JavaScript-based)
- Scene setup with **segmentation, animation controllers**, and **logic triggers**
- Asset integration for custom icons, filters, or overlays

## 🎨 Visual Design

All graphics were lovingly illustrated by my high school best friend to give the filter a **personal and polished touch**. 
The custom looks were created for a prototype and for later customization while usage.
